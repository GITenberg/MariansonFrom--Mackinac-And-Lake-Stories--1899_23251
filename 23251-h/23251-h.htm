    <h2>
      From &ldquo;Mackinac And Lake Stories&rdquo;, 1899 <br /><br /> By Mary Hartwell
      Catherwood <br /><br />
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the British landed on the west side of Mackinac Island at three
      o'clock in the morning of July 17,1812, Canadians were ordered to
      transport the cannon. They had only a pair of six-pounders, but these had
      to be dragged across the long alluvial stretch to heights which would
      command the fortress, and sand, rock, bushes, trees, and fallen logs made
      it a dreadful portage. Voyageurs, however, were men to accomplish what
      regulars and Indians shirked.
    </p>
    <p>
      All but one of the hundred and sixty Canadians hauled with a good will on
      the cannon ropes. The dawn was glimmering. Paradise hid in the untamed
      island, breathing dew and spice. The spell worked instantly upon that one
      young voyageur whose mind was set against the secret attack. All night his
      rage had been swelling. He despised the British regulars-forty-two lords
      of them only being in this expedition-as they in turn despised his class.
      They were his conquerors. He had no desire to be used as means of pushing
      their conquest further. These islanders he knew to be of his own race,
      perhaps crossed with Chippewa blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven hundred Indians, painted and horned for war, skulked along as allies
      in the dim morning twilight. He thought of sleeping children roused by
      tomahawk and scalping-knife in case the surprised fort did not immediately
      surrender. Even then, how were a few hundred white men to restrain nearly
      a thousand savages?
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Canadian, as a rush was made with the ropes, stumbled over a log
      and dropped behind a bush. His nearest companions scarcely noticed the
      desertion in their strain, but the officer instantly detailed an Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of you Sioux bring that fellow back or bring his scalp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A Sioux stretched forward and leaped eagerly into the woods. All the boy's
      years of wilderness training were concentrated on an escape. The English
      officer meant to make him a lesson to the other voyageurs. And he smiled
      as he thought of the race he could give the Sioux. All his arms except his
      knife were left behind the bush; for fleet-ness was to count in this
      venture. The game of life or death was a pretty one, to be enjoyed as he
      shot from tree to tree, or like a noiseless-hoofed deer made a long
      stretch of covert. He was alive through every blood drop. The dewy glory
      of dawn had never seemed so great. Cool as the Sioux whom he dodged, his
      woodsman's eye gathered all aspects of the strange forest. A detached
      rock, tall as a tree, raised its colossal altar, surprising the eye like a
      single remaining temple pillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old logs, scaled as in a coat of mail, testified to the humidity of this
      lush place. The boy trod on sweet white violets smelling of incense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wooded deeps unfolded in thinning dusk and revealed a line of high
      verdant cliffs walling his course. He dashed through hollows where
      millions of ferns bathed him to the knees. As daylight grew&mdash;though
      it never was quite daylight there-so did his danger. He expected to hear
      the humming of an arrow, and perhaps to feel a shock and sting and
      cleaving of the bolt, and turned in recklessly to climb for the uplands,
      where after miles of jutting spurs the ridge stooped and pushed out in
      front of itself a round-topped rock. As the Canadian passed this rock a
      yellow flare like candle-light came through a crack at its base.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped on all-fours. The Indian was not in sight. He squirmed within a
      low battlement of serrated stone guarding the crack, and let himself down
      into what appeared to be the mouth of a cave. The opening was so low as to
      be invisible just outside the serrated breastwork. He found himself in a
      room of rock, irregularly hollow above, with a candle burning on the stone
      floor. As he sat upright and stretched forth a hand to pinch off the
      flame, the image of a sleeping woman was printed on his eyeballs so that
      he saw every careless ring of fair hair around her head and every curve of
      her body for hours afterwards in the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first thought was to place himself where his person would intercept
      any attack at the mouth of the cave. Knife in hand, he waited for a
      horned, glittering-eyed face to stoop or an arrow or hatchet to glance
      under that low rim, the horizon of his darkness. His chagrin at having
      taken to a trap and drawn danger on a woman was poignant; the candle had
      caught him like a moth, and a Sioux would keenly follow. Still, no
      lightest step betrayed the Sioux's knowledge of his whereabouts. A long
      time passed before he relaxed to an easy posture and turned to the
      interior of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drip of a veiled water-vein at the rear made him conscious of thirst,
      but the sleeping woman was in the way of his creeping to take a drink.
      Wrapped in a fur robe, she lay breathing like an infant, white-skinned,
      full-throated, and vigorous, a woman older than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0001" id="linkimage-0001">

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

    </div>
    <p>
      The consequences of her waking did not threaten him as perilous. Without
      reasoning, he was convinced that a woman who lay down to sleep beside a
      burning candle in this wild place would make no outcry when she awoke and
      found the light had drawn instead of kept away possible cave-inhabitants.
      Day grew beyond the low sill and thinned obscurity around him, showing the
      swerve of the roof to a sloping shelf. Perspiration cooled upon him and he
      shivered. A fire and a breakfast would have been good things, which he had
      often enjoyed in danger. Rowing all night, and landing cannon at the end
      of it, and running a league or more for life, exhausted a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman stirred, and the young voyageur thought of dropping his knife
      back into its sheath. At the slight click she sat up, drawing in her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whispered: &ldquo;Do not be afraid. I have not come in here to hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was staring at him, probably taking him for some monster of the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman resumed her suspended breath, and answered in the same guarded
      way, and in French like his: &ldquo;Yes. I come to this part of the island so of
      ten that I have put bread and meat and candles in the cave. How did you
      find it? No one but myself knew about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the candle-light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The candle was to keep off evil spirits. It has been blown out. Where did
      you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From St. Joseph Island last night with the English. They have taken the
      island by surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She unexpectedly laughed in a repressed gurgle, as a faun or other woods
      creature might have laughed at the predicaments of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking of the stupid American soldiers&mdash;to lie asleep and let
      the British creep in upon them. But have you seen my cow? I searched
      everywhere, until the moon went down and I was tired to death, for my
      cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I saw no cow. I had the Sioux to watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Sioux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Indian our commandant sent after me. Speak low. He may be listening
      outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They themselves listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Indians have come on the island they will kill all the cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the women and children and men&mdash;even poor voyageurs&mdash;for
      them to kill first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gasped, &ldquo;Is it war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never have seen war. Why did you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not want to, mademoiselle, and I deserted. That is why the Indian
      was sent after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not call me mademoiselle. I am Marianson Bruelle, the widow of André
      Chenier. Our houses will be burned, and our gardens trampled, and our
      boats stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if the fort surrenders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again they harkened to the outside world in suspense. The deserter had
      expected to hear cannon before sunlight so slowly crept under the cave's
      lip. It was as if they sat within a colossal skull, broad between the ears
      but narrowing towards the top, with light coming through the parted mouth.
      Accustomed to the soft twilight, the two could see each other, and the
      woman covertly put her dress in order while she talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than fearlessness, even a kind of maternal passion, moved her. She
      searched in the back of the cave and handed her strange guest food, and
      gathered him a birch cup of water from the dripping rock. The touch of his
      fingers sent a new vital thrill through her. Two may talk together under
      the same roof for many years, yet never really meet; and two others at
      first speech are old friends. She did not know this young voyageur, yet
      she began to claim him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so tired that the tan of his cheek turned leaden in the cave gloom.
      She rose from her bearskin and spread it for him, when he finished eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot go out now,&rdquo; he whispered, when he saw her intention. &ldquo;The
      Sioux is somewhere in the woods watching for me. The Indians came on this
      island for scalps. You will not be safe, even in the fort, until the fight
      is over, or until night comes again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianson, standing convinced by what he said, was unable to take her eyes
      off him. Mass seemed always irksome to her in spite of the frequent
      changes of posture and her conviction that it was good for her soul. She
      was at her happiest plunging through woods or panting up cliffs which
      squaws dared not scale. Yet enforced hiding with a stranger all day in the
      cave was assented to by this active sylvan creature. She had not a word to
      say against it, and the danger of going out was her last thought. The
      cavern's mouth was a very awkward opening to crawl through, especially if
      an Indian should catch one in the act. There was nothing to do but to sit
      down and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sigh of pleasure, as at inhaling the spirit of a flower, escaped her
      lips. This lad, whose presence she knew she would feel without seeing if
      he came into church behind her, innocent of the spell he was casting,
      still sat guarding the entrance, though the droop of utter weariness
      relaxed every posture. Marianson bade him lie down on the fur robe, and
      imperiously arranged her lap to hold his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am maman to you. I say to you sleep, and you shall sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appealing and thankful eyes of the boy were closed almost as soon as
      he crept upon the robe and his head sunk in its comfortable pillow.
      Marianson braced her back against the wall and dropped her hands at her
      sides. Occasionally she glanced at the low rim of light. No Indian could
      enter without lying flat. She had little dread of the Sioux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every globule which fell in darkness from the rock recorded, like the sand
      grain of an hour-glass, some change in Marianson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I not care for anybody, me,&rdquo; had been her boast when she tantalized
      soldiers on the village street. Her gurgle of laughter, and the hair
      blowing on her temples from under the blanket she drew around her face,
      worked havoc in Mackinac. To her men were merely useful objects, like
      cows, or houses, or gardens, or boats. She hugged the social liberty of a
      woman who had safely passed through matrimony and widowhood. Married to
      old André Chenier by her parents, that he might guard her after their
      death, she loathed the thought of another wearisome tie, and called it
      veneration of his departed spirit. He left her a house, a cow, and a boat.
      Accustomed to work for him, she found it much easier to work for herself
      when he was gone, and resented having young men hang around desiring to
      settle in her house. She laughed at every proposal a father or mother made
      her. No family on the island could get her, and all united in pointing her
      out as a bad pattern for young women.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bloom like the rose flushing of early maidenhood came over Marianson
      with her freedom. Isolated and daring and passionless, she had no
      conception of the scandal she caused in the minds of those who carried the
      burdens of the community, but lived like a bird of the air. Wives who bore
      children and kept the pot boiling found it hard to see her tiptoeing over
      cares which swallowed them. She did not realize that maids desired to
      marry and she took their lovers from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But knowledge grew in her as she sat holding the stranger's head in her
      lap, though it was not a day on which to trouble one's self with
      knowledge. There was only the forest's voice outside, that ceaseless
      majestic hymn of the trees, accompanied by the shore ripple, which was
      such a little way off. Languors like the sweet languors of spring came
      over her. She was happier than she had ever been before in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is delicious,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I have been in the cave many times, but
      it will never be like this again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was a strange joy to find the touch of a human being something to
      delight in. There was sweet wickedness in it; penance might have to
      follow. What would the curé say if he saw her? To amuse one's self with
      soldiers and islanders was one thing; to sit tranced all day in a cave
      with a stranger must be another.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rough innocence in his relaxed body&mdash;beautiful as the
      virgin softness of a girl. Under the spell of his unconscious domination,
      she did not care about his past. Her own past was nothing. She had arrived
      in the present. Time stood still. His face was turned towards her, and she
      studied all its curves, yet knew if he had other features he would still
      be the one person in the world who could so draw her. What was the power?
      Had women elsewhere felt it? At that thought she had a pang of anguish and
      rage altogether new to her. Marianson was tender even in her amusements;
      her benevolence extended to dumb cattle; but in the hidden darkness of her
      consciousness she found herself choosing the Sioux for him, rather than a
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he half raised his head, but again let it sink to its rest. Marianson
      grew faint; and as the light waned at the cave mouth she remembered she
      had not eaten anything that day. The fast made her seem fit to say
      prayers, and she said all she knew over his head, like a mother brooding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He startled her by sitting up, without warning, fully roused and alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; inquired the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the door. The sun has long been behind the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I slept all day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you heard no sound of battle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been still as the village street during mass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, have they done, those English? They must have taken the fort
      without firing a gun. And the Sioux-you have not seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has passed the cave door, not even a chipmunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stretched his arms upward into the hollow, standing tall and well made,
      his buckskin shirt turned back from his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am again hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also,&rdquo; said Marianson. &ldquo;I have not eaten anything to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion dropped on his knees before her and took out of her hands
      the food she had ready. His face expressed shame and compunction as he fed
      her himself, offering bites to her mouth with gentle persistence. She
      laughed the laugh peculiar to herself, and pushed his hand back to his own
      lips. So they ate together, and afterwards drank from the same cup.
      Marianson showed him where the drops came down, and he gathered them,
      smiling at her from the depths of the cave. They heard the evening cawing
      of crows, and the waters rushing with a wilder wash on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bring more bread and meat when I come back,&rdquo; promised Marianson&mdash;&ldquo;unless
      the English have burned the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. When it is dark I will leave the cave myself,&rdquo; said the voyageur. &ldquo;Is
      there any boat near by that I can take to escape in from the island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my boat. But it is at the post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far are we from the post?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so far if one might cross the island; but to go by the west
      shore, which would be safest, perhaps, in time of war, that is the greater
      part of the island's girth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drew near together as they murmured, and at intervals he held the cup
      to her lips, making up for his forgetfulness when benumbed with sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One has but to follow the shore, however,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;And where can I
      find the boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot find it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, with sudden recollection, &ldquo;I could never return it
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianson saw on the cave's rough wall a vision of her boat carrying him
      away. Her own little craft, the sail of which she knew how to trim&mdash;her
      bird, her flier, her food-winner&mdash;was to become her robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the war is over,&rdquo; she ventured, &ldquo;then you might come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to explain difficulties like an honest lad, and she stopped him.
      &ldquo;I do not want to know anything. I want you to take my boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put the cup down and seized her hands and kissed them. She crouched
      against the cave's side, her eyes closed. If he was only grateful to her
      for bread and shelter and means of escape, it was little enough she
      received, but his warm touch and his lips on her palms&mdash;for he kissed
      her palms&mdash;made her none the less dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said Marianson. &ldquo;If I give you my boat, you must do
      exactly as I bid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stay here until I bring it to you. I am going at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you cannot go alone in the dark. You are a woman&mdash;you will be
      afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in my life have I been afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are Indians on the war-path now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be in camp or drunk at the post. Your Sioux has left this part
      of the island. He may come back by morning, but he would not camp away
      from so much plunder. Sioux cannot be unlike our Chippewas. Do you think,&rdquo;
       demanded Marianson, &ldquo;that you will be quite, quite safe in the cave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I find the cave unsafe I can leave it; but you in the dark alone&mdash;you
      must let me go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the risk is too great. It is better for me to go alone. I know every
      rock, every bend of the shore. The pull back around the island will be
      hardest, if there is not enough wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go with you,&rdquo; decided the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you gave me your promise to do exactly as I bade you. I am older than
      you,&rdquo; said Marianson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what is best, and that is that you remain here until I come. Swear
      to me that you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, beseeching her with his eyes to relent. Then, owning her
      right to dominate, he pledged her by the name of his saint to do as she
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their forced companionship, begun at daylight, was ending as darkness
      crept through the cavern's mouth. They waited, and those last moments of
      silence, while they leaned to look closely at each other with the night
      growing between them, were a benediction on the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianson stooped to creep through the cavern's mouth, but once more she
      turned and looked at him, and it was she herself who stretched appealing
      arms. The boy's shyness and the woman's aversion to men vanished as in
      fire. They stood together in the hollow of the cave in one long embrace.
      He sought her mouth and kissed her, and, suffocating with joy, she escaped
      through the low door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indifferent to the Indian who might be dogging her, she drew her strip of
      home-spun around her face and ran, moccasined and deft-footed, over the
      stones, warm, palpitating, and laughing, full of physical hardihood. In
      the woods, on her left, she knew there were rocks splashed with stain
      black as ink and crusted with old lichens. On her right white-caps were
      running before the west wind and diving like ducks on the strait. She
      crossed the threads of a brook ravelling themselves from density. For the
      forest was a mask. But Marianson knew well the tricks of that brook&mdash;its
      pellucid shining on pebbles, its cascades, its hidings underground of all
      but a voice and a crystal pool. Wet to her knees, she had more than once
      followed it to its source amid such greenery of moss and logs as seemed a
      conflagration of verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The many points and bays of the island sped behind her, and cliffs crowded
      her to the water's edge or left her a dim moving object on a lonesome
      beach. Sometimes she heard sounds in the woods and listened; on the other
      hand, she had the companionship of stars and moving water. On that
      glorified journey Marianson's natural fearlessness carried her past the
      Devil's Kitchen and quite near the post before she began to consider how
      it was best to approach a place which might be in the hands of an enemy.
      Her boat was tied at the dock. She had the half-ruined distillery yet to
      pass. It had stood under the cliff her lifetime. As she drew nearer,
      cracks of light and a hum like the droning of a beehive magically turned
      the old distillery into a caravansary of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in her long tramp had startled her like this. It was a relief to
      hear the click of metal and a strange-spoken word, and to find herself
      face to face with an English soldier. He made no parley, but marched her
      before him; and the grateful noise of squalling babies and maternal
      protests and Maman Pelott's night lullaby also met her as they proceeded
      towards the distillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long dark shed had a chimney-stack and its many-coiled still in one
      end. Beside that great bottle-shaped thing, at the base of the chimney,
      was an open fireplace piled with flaming sticks, and this had made the
      luminous crevices. All Mackinac village was gathered within the walls, and
      Marian-son beheld a camp supping, putting children to bed on blankets in
      corners, sitting and shaking fingers at one another in wrathful council,
      or running about in search of lost articles. The curé was there, keeping a
      restraint on his people. Clothes hung on spikes like rows of suicides in
      the weird light. Even fiddlers and jollity were not lacking. A heavier
      race would have come to blows in that strait enclosure, but these French
      and half-breeds, in danger of scalping if the Indians proved turbulent,
      dried their eyes after losses, and shook their legs ready for a dance at
      the scraping of a violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Ignace Pelott was directly pulling at Mari-anson's petticoat to get
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Ingins kill our 'effer,&rdquo; he lamented, in the mongrel speech of the
      quarter-breed. &ldquo;Dey didn't need him; dey have plenty to eat. But dey kill
      our 'effer and laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cow, is it also killed, Ignace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marianson's neighbors closed around her, unsurprised at her late arrival,
      filled only with the general calamity. Old men's pipe smoke mingled with
      odors of food; and when the English soldier had satisfied himself that she
      belonged to this caldron of humanity, he lifted the corners of his nose
      and returned to open air and guard duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fort had been surrendered without a shot, to save the lives of the
      villagers, and they were all hurried to the distillery and put under
      guard. They would be obliged to take the oath of allegiance to England, or
      leave the island. Michael Dousman, yet held in the enemy's camp, was
      fiercely accused of bringing the English upon them. No, Marianson could
      not go to the village, or even to the dock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody offered her food. A boat she did not ask for. The high cobwebby
      openings of the distillery looked on a blank night sky. Marianson felt her
      happiness jarred as the wonderful day came to such limits. The English had
      the island. It might be searched for that young deserter waiting for her
      help, and if she failed to get a boat, what must be his fate?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had entered the west door of the distillery. She found opportunity to
      slip out on the east side, for it was necessary to reach the dock and get
      a boat. She might risk being scalped, but a boat at any cost she would
      have, and one was sent her&mdash;as to the fearless and determined all
      their desires are sent. She heard the thump of oars in rowlocks, bringing
      the relief guard, and with a swish, out of the void of the lake a keel ran
      upon pebbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      So easy had been the conquest of the island, the British regular found his
      amusement in his duty, and a boat was taken from the dock to save half a
      mile of easy marching. It stood empty and waiting during a lax minute,
      while the responsibility of guarding was shifted; but perhaps being
      carelessly beached, though there was no tide on the strait, it drifted
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianson, who had helped it drift, lay flat on the bottom and heard the
      rueful oaths of her enemies, forced to march back to the post. There was
      no sail. She steered by a trailing oar until lighted distillery and black
      cliff receded and it was safe for her to fix her sculls and row with all
      her might.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so tired her heart physically ached when she slipped through dawn
      to a landing opposite the cave. There would be no more yesterdays, and
      there would be no time for farewells. The wash which drove her roughly to
      mooring drove with her the fact that she did not know even the name of the
      man she was about to give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianson turned and looked at the water he must venture upon, without a
      sail to help him. It was not all uncovered from the night, but a long
      purple current ran out, as if God had made a sudden amethyst bridge across
      the blue strait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reluctant as she was to call him from the cave, she dared not delay. The
      breath of the virgin woods was overpoweringly sweet. Her hair clung to her
      forehead in moist rings, and her cheeks were pallid and wet with mist
      which rose and rose on all sides like clouds in a holy picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crouched down on cold hands and saw that. He had waited in the cave as
      he promised, and had fallen asleep. His back was towards her. Instead of
      lying at ease, his body was flexed. Her enlarging pupils caught a stain of
      red on the bear-skin, then the scarlet tonsure on his crown. He was
      asleep, but the Sioux had been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low song of wind along that wooded ridge, and the roar of dashing lake
      water, repeated their monotone hour after hour. It proved as fair a day as
      the island had ever seen, and when it was nearly spent, Marianson Bruelle
      still sat on the cave floor holding the dead boy in her arms.
      Heart-uprooting was a numbness, like rapture. At least he could not leave
      her. She had his kiss, his love. She had his body, to hide in a grave as
      secret as a flower's. The curé could some time bless it, but the English
      who had slain him should never know it. As she held him to her breast, so
      the sweet processes of the woods should hold him, and make him part of the
      island.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
